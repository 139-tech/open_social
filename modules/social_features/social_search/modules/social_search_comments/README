This module fills a quick and dirty need. It uses a configuration override so
that it can be enabled and disabled easily and leaves no permanent changes.
It's been hidden so that unsuspecting users can't accidentally turn it on before
we are ready to support it.

The module aims to add comments for indexing to the "All" and "Content" search
indexes.

Post comments are excluded because posts themselves are also not visible in
search.
