 * A list of strings in older Open Social versions than current stable release.
 *
 * This file contains translatable strings that have been altered or changed in
 * the Open Social distribution. By wrapping these strings in the Drupal::t() or
 * Drupal::formatPlural function in this file, they will be picked up by the
 * POTX tool automatically. This ensures that they can be translated in the Open
 * Social translation workflow for older versions of Open Social.
 *
 * When adding texts to this file. Please specify in which version the string
 * was changed so that it can be cleaned up in the future when all platforms
 * are using at least that version.
